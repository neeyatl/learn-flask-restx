# Project to implement Flask, RESTX and SQLAlchemy concepts
## To test it out
- Create a virtual environment and install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run the custom command `flask main recreate_test_db` to load the db fixtures.
- Run `flask run` after activating the venv, then play with the implementation.
