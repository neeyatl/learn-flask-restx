# Project to implement Flask, RESTX and SQLAlchemy concepts
## To test it out
- Create a virtual environment and install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Make sure to run all the functions from `app/init_test_db.py` in flask shell to load the db fixtures. Access the shell using the command `flask shell`.
- Run `flask run` after activating the venv, then play with the implementation.
